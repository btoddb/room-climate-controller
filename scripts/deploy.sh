# it as a frontend module (add_extra_js_url) with no-cache headers, so after this
# runs you only need to HARD-REFRESH the browser — there is no Lovelace resource
# to add and no Home Assistant restart required.
#
# Requires Node/npm (provided by the devcontainer's Node feature).

# --- 1. Install deps first (clean, correct-platform native binaries). This is the

# --- 2. Bump patch version (package.json) and sync the console banner so you can
#        confirm in the browser console which build actually loaded. The version is
#        compiled into the bundle, so it must be bumped before the build. Back up the
#        two touched files and roll them back if the build/deploy fails, so a broken
#        build never leaves a bumped-but-unbuilt (dirty, inconsistent) tree. ---
